# Multilingual Language Translation System

## Overview
This project implements a multilingual Neural Machine Translation system using a pretrained Transformer-based NLLB (No Language Left Behind) model. The system supports translation between multiple languages using a single unified model.

## Supported Languages
- English
- Hindi
- Gujarati
- any many more over 200 languages

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Hugging Face Transformers
- NLLB Multilingual Model
- Flask Web Framework

## Working
1. User enters text
2. Selects source and target language
3. Transformer model translates the input text
4. Output is displayed in real-time

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```
📌 The Jupyter notebook (main.ipynb) is the primary source of implementation and evaluation.
